## 🚀 Hackathon Problem Statement

**What problem is your submission addressing?**  
Social media managers, creators, and students spend too much time rewriting, formatting, and polishing posts for different platforms.  
They often juggle between apps just to create a caption, add hashtags, or translate content.

**How Spark solves this:**
- Generates platform-optimized captions in one click.
- Rewrites, summarizes, and translates content instantly.
- Auto-generates drafts via an AI Agent that runs on schedule.
- Allows direct posting to X (Twitter) via API or manual Web Intent.
- Saves drafts so users can review, pick a variant, or delete.
